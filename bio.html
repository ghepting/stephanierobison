  The sculpture of Stephanie Robison plays with multiple oppositional relationships.
  Created out of wood, fabric, stone, steel, foam, and plastic her works synthesize and
  fuse: organic and geometric, natural and architectural, soft with hard, the handmade
  and the uniform industrial. Robison’s work often uses humor or the absurd to
  address uncontrollable aspects of the body, the self, the environment, and
  relationships.
